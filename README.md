# ODD (On Demand Delivery)

ODD is an on-demand delivery app, where users can make request to deliver their packages from one location to another within India(for now some of the selected cities)

Most of the time what happens is, If someone wants to deliver a package to another location, they have to search nearby â€œTruck wala or Rrickshaw wala" with no fixed prices. ODD tries to solve the problems by providing a platform where users can find and book the vehicle that suits their needs, and deliver packages to the destination without any extra effort and within fair price.

## Roles

- USER - A person who wants to send the package
- DRIVER - A person who is responsible for delivering a package
- ADMIN - A person who can see statistics of services and details of Users, Drivers and Orders.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Socket](https://socket.io/)
